For project 3, Rebecca Pope and I would like to interview graduate students to provide a knowledge base for incoming graduate students at UNT. We plan to interview people that we know through TC as well as graduate students in the College of Engineering, Graduate Student Council, and other graduate students on the UNT campus. We do not anticipate finding interview participants because both of us work with students, and we have access to other graduate students on campus.

We came up with the following questions.

1. What forms do you need when enrolling?
2. Did you know where to find these forms?
3. What IT information did you need to enroll/after enrolling? (my UNT, email, Blackboard, MyUNT, etc.)
4. What information did you need to enroll in classes/sign up for classes for the first semester?
5. What academic information (GPA, minimum GPA for scholarships and work, etc.) did you need?
6. What information would help students to find and contact UNT International?
7. Which offices do you visit the most? Examples can be UNT International, Toulouse Graduate School, Registrar’s Office, UNT Admissions, Scholarships and Financial Aid.
8. Which part of your UNT application/enrollment experience has been the most difficult?
9. How did you find out about UNT funding, scholarship, and employment opportunities? Please name any resources that were helpful and those that were not.
10. What were the 3 most important resources for you as an incoming student?
11. What are the 3 most important resources for you as a continuing student?
