	<h1>Response to Clark & Andersen Article </h1>
	<p>In this article, Clark and Andersen address their concerns regarding technical communicators focus on technologies as tools and not on technologies as a way to influence organizations. They mention XML as a technology that not only helps with single-sourcing but also with influencing the way an organization can use data. They provide a block quote from J.D. Applen who mentions that, "XML offers them a way to provide not just data, but data with context," which provides an interesting framework to view technology. We can use tools and technologies to display our value to an organization and its employees. The article essentially argues that we can use technologies to influence organizations by expanding our view of 'user' to include the people within an organization. </p>
	
	<p>We can implement Clark and Andersen's ideas regarding sustainable technical communication by not only learning tools but also learning how the tools can be valuable to the organization. While end users may be the primary audience and reason for the tools/technolgies, organizational employees may be the primary audience for separate applications of the same tools/technologies, as is the case with XML. XML allows us to pull information from a central location and display it in multiple formats. It also makes data easier to manage and search, both of which are beneficial to an organization.</p>
	
	<p>Clark and Andersen also devote a large part of the article to discussing how practitioners and educators can modify their understanding of technologies and organizations to include a more sustainable role for technical communicators. They recommend that practitioners understand how businesses use technology and that academics expand technical communication beyond rhetoric and include more training for working and functioning as a technical communicator in an organization. It seems that looking at tools/technology from the organizational perspective will make us more valuable to an organization but also, ultimately, to the user. If we can streamline processes within an organization by using tools like XML, we can benefit customers/users by moving more quickly and providing information more quickly and efficiently.</p>
