	<h1>XSLT and Technical Communication</h1>
		<p>XSLT is the abbreviation for EXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations, and it gives style to XML and allows users to transform XML into other documents, such as PDFs, HTML for webpages, and others. On its own, XML is great for organizing information but not for displaying it in a useful way. XSLT transforms XML data because the XML data is modified to include XSLT statements and is then parsed through a browser or a program to display the data to the user. XSLT adds power to XML because it makes the data accessible and attractive to the end user by defining tags and adding style.</p>
		
		<p>XSLT is important to technical communicators because it takes much of the work out of content management because the data in one XML or more files can be displayed in an appropriate manner, given style, and used in multiple formats. For XML files with multiple sets of data, XSLT is extremely valuable because the data can be combined in different ways to depending on what we want to display. For instance, we can take detailed data about the population of the US and break it down to display very specific information about a specific demographic group within a state or use the information to show a broad view of the US population. XSLT also helps us because it helps us to keep information consistent across media, use repetition to help users establish a schema, and maintain accuracy when presenting information. We can make sure the data and information is consistently displayed in the same format and uses the same colors, fonts, font sizes, and other design features to help users connect the dots between different documents or media.</p>
