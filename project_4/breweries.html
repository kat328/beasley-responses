		<h2>Breweries in DFW</h2>
		<img src="craft-beer2.jpg" alt="craft" style="float:right;width:300px;height:300px;padding-right:10px;">
		<p>Dallas-Fort Worth is home to many craft breweries. Some have been around for years, such as Rahr & Sons Brewing Co. which opened in 2004. Others, such as Audacity Brew House have opened just recently. According to the Beer Institute, Texas' brewing industry has contributed over $7,335,814,900 to the statewide economy and created 160,390 jobs.</p>
		<p>All the competition between craft brewers is driving the costs down as brewers are working to grab part of the market share, so customers can often get excellent deals on locally brewed beers. Additionally, the growing popularity of craft beer means that beer lovers can try new beers at their local bars and take them home from their local grocery stores.
