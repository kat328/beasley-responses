This article expanded my view of TC and our roles within companies because I did not realize how much management and maintenance goes into helping others with content. Most of the articles we read revolve around jobs where we kind of single-handedly manage content that we create or are responsible for creating. I had not really thought about our role in managing the data of the entire organization. The idea that organizations themselves are made of bits of information is an interesting one, and it really puts the relevance of data/content into perspective. As long as we are an information economy, organizations will continue to rely on information in all forms; this puts technical communicators in a place where we can remain relevant by taking on new roles that involve new forms of data/content and not just writing. 

The point he makes about writing being more than just a "basic skill" and should be a strategic, organization-wide activity is relevant. Everyone is expected to be good at writing, but emphasis is not placed on writing well once they are on the job. We can become advocates for good writing as a whole and display our value to an organization by becoming writing experts. Subject matter experts come in each field, and ours is TC. 

Both of these topics still tie into users, and a reference is made in this article to providing information to the user in the way that he/she needs it. Content managers even make information more user friendly for both the end viewers and those who deal with the content on a regular basis. We can almost consider our interactions with our coworkers and users as a ‘customer service’-type role where we provide useful assistance to the users, whomever they may be. If we continue to advocate for ourselves and provide excellent work that is helpful to our coworkers, they will think we are valuable. Human relationships cannot be outsourced after all.
