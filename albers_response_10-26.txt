This article brings the craftsman model of TC into perspective and juxtaposes it with the new view of TC and how it relates to single sourcing. As technical communication students, we often work in isolation and own each of the documents we create from start to finish. This serves an excellent purpose because we get to learn about the process of designing documents or writing XML and making it useful. However, Albers' perspective makes me concerned that I do not know how to unify information with a group and make the information seamless from one writer to another. So far in this class, we have learned the value of single sourcing and how it makes information more dynamic and user-friendly. In project 2, I got a feel for how single sourcing can help in the information retrieval and display processes. However, I never really considered how having access to so much information can make it difficult to determine what is most important and how to package it in useful ways. Baker makes the case that we should include everything and pull out what we need later, but I feel like in project 2, I just included everything and pulled out everything. I think I might have gotten caught up in learning how to use new technologies and forgotten why they are powerful. 

The information Albers provides about TC practitioners at different stages of their careers foreshadows what we can expect when entering the job market, and it makes sense that we would have to work our way into positions where we can analyze information. However, it makes me apprehensive that I have learned how to write clearly and design documents, but I do not necessarily know how to analyze information to determine what is important. Like Albers mentions in the article, his students think everything is important when they are put on the spot. My idea of ‘editing’ changed by reading this article, because I need to know how to edit information to determine what is important in addition to editing text to make it grammatically correct and concise.
