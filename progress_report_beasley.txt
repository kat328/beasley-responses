To this point, I have compiled the required data for the project, entered a sample set of 6 entries into an XML file, and transformed the XML with XSLT. I originally wanted to make a database of all the beers that are produced in Texas, but that proved to be a very large dataset. I have reduced the dataset to include breweries in the DFW area and the beers they produce. I tested the XML file, and it is valid. I opted to use the small sample set in my XML file until I make the final decisions about the design and style of the table. It took me quite a while to transform the XML file into XSLT because I forgot some of the symbols and had to diagnose the problems. I used the W3 Schools transformation information, so my table basically looks like the samples on w3schools.org. I have not begun to style the table with CSS yet; this is one of my goals for the in-class workshop. At this point, I feel optimistic that I can complete the project with plenty of time to spare, but I also recognize that I will be likely to run into problems when I try to include styles. 

The questions I have mostly relate to the style of the table. CSS adds style to HTML files. From what I understand, once XML is transformed with XSLT, the file becomes viewable in a browser, but it is not HTML until it is made into an HTML file. If this is the case, then which file do I include the CSS style into, or am I completely misunderstanding CSS? Next, when we viewed Victor's project last week, he included introductions to the information. If we turn in a file that includes only the table, will that be enough to meet the requirements for the project? I would like to exceed the project requirements, but I want to make sure I don't miss any of the minimums.
